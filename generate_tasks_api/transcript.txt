Manager:
 Thanks for hopping on, Christie. I wanted to check in about MapEasy and where we’re headed next with it.
Christie:
 Sure — we’ve been watching usage patterns closely. Navigation’s solid, but discovery features could use more engagement.
Manager:
 Right, and that’s why I wanted to raise something. We’ve been thinking — what if we integrated MapEasy with our Reviews app?
Christie:
 Ah, so like showing nearby restaurants or businesses along with user ratings and comments?
Manager:
 Exactly. It could drive more usage and make our maps more useful in context. Can you talk to Jane from the Reviews team about how this might work?
Christie:
 Will do. I’ll set something up with her and explore integration options.
Manager:
 Great. Let’s aim for an initial proposal by next week.
Christie:
 You got it. Thanks!
